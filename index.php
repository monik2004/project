            :: Blood Basics ::
        </h1>
        <p class="infoPara">
            Our blood is a living tissue with a variety of critical functions. It delivers oxygen and nutrients to our organs, fights infections and creates blood clots, preventing us from bleeding excessively when a blood vessel is damaged. The liquid part of our blood, called plasma, is key for maintaining blood pressure and supplying critical proteins for blood clotting, immunity and maintaining the correct pH balance in our body -- critical to cell function. Plasma also carries the solid part of our blood -- white blood cells, which work to destroy viruses and bacteria; red blood cells, which carry oxygen through the body, and platelets, which help clotting.

            :: About Blood Groups ::
        </h1>
        <p class="infoPara">
            There are 4 main blood groups (types of blood) - A, B, AB and O. Your blood group is determined by the genes you inherit from your parents.
            <br><br>
            Each group can be either RhD Positive or RhD Negative, which means in total there are <span> eight main blood groups.</span>
            <br>
            Blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in a liquid called plasma. Your blood group is identified by <span> antibodies and antigens </span> in the blood.
            <br>
            <span> Antibodies </span> are proteins found in plasma. They're part of our body's natural defences. They recognise foreign substances, such as germs, and alert your immune system, which destroys them.
            <br>
            <span> Antigens</span> are proteins molecules found on the surface of red blood cells.
        </p>

            :: The ABO System ::
        </h1>
        <p class="infoPara">
            There are four main blood groups defined by the ABO System :
            <br> <span> --> A blood group </span> - has only the A antigen on red cells (and B antibody in the plasma)
            <br> <span> --> B blood group </span> - has only the B antigen on red cells (and A antibody in the plasma)
            <br> <span> --> O blood group </span> - has neither the A or the B antigen on red cells (but both A and B antibody in the plasma)
            <br> <span> --> AB blood grou </span>p - has both the A and the B antigen on red cells (but neither A and B antibody in the plasma)
            <br><br>
            Blood group O is the most common blood group. Almost half of the UK population (48%) has blood group O. <br>
            Receiving blood from the wrong ABO group can be life threatening. For example, if someone with group B blood is given group A blood, their anti-A antibodies will attack the group A cells.

            :: Giving Blood ::
        </h1>
        <p class="infoPara">
            Most people are able to give blood, but only 4% actually do. You can donate blood if you : <br>
           <br> --> are fit and healthy.
           <br> --> weight at least 50kg (7st 12lb)
           <br> --> are 17-66 years old (or 70 if you've given blood before)
           <br> --> are over 70 and have given blood in the last two years
           <br><br>
           The percentage of people donating blood is increasing day by day due to awareness to donate for those needed. The blood received have to be managed throughly so that there will be no negative effect to the blood receiver once they received blood.
           <br><br>
           One of the factor of the public afraid to donate their blood is they believe in myths. The myths that they always believe are, if they donate their blood they will become fat and if they donate their blood, their blood will become less in total of amount and they will become pale. This BBMS should provide more information in order to educate the public so that they know blood donation will not give bad effects. By giving awareness to the public, this will increase volunteers to donate their blood.
